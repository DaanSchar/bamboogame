The way I have named all my networks (or most of them at least), is this way:

"network-hybrid-" accuracy "-" learningRate "-" maxEpochs ".zip"

if you want to name yours different, that's fine too (although I do think we should agree on one standard, so let's discuss that next time),
but please don't use numbers in the same place but of different values. As that would be confusing.

I haven't added the accuracy to all networks yet though, but I'm working on it


accuracy:
    run the evaluate() method in Main.java

learningRate:
    Network.java, line 45

maxEpochs:
    Network.java, line 19
